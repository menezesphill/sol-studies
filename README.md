### [Cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en/course)

Cryptozombies is a good starter course, the course itself is broken/unmaintained and to move through the chapters you need to edit the chapter number on your browser, but still, the content is relevant.

### [Ethers.js Docs](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)

The ethers.js library aims to be a complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem.

### [web3.js Docs](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.7.3/index.html#)

web3.js is a collection of libraries that allow you to interact with a local or remote ethereum node using HTTP, IPC or WebSocket.

### [Ethereum Smart Contract - Best Practices](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/)

Baseline knowledge of security considerations for intermediate Solidity programmers.

### [Gas Optimization](https://github.com/kadenzipfel/gas-optimizations)

Repo with compiled info about Gas Saving Patters, a highly-valued skill among blockchain developers.

### [Solidity by Example](https://github.com/raineorshine/solidity-by-example)

This is a collection of Solidity snippets for people who like to learn by example.

### [Hacking the Blockchain with Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/)

Wargame played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'.

### [VestingVault](https://github.com/menezesphill/vestingVault) and [VestingVault DAPP](https://github.com/menezesphill/vestingVault-dapp)

One of my personal repositories, VestingVault is a simple implementation of a graded vesting contract. VestingVault DAPP is an example on how to integrate the Smart Contract to a simple Vanilla JS app using Metamask and web3.js.
